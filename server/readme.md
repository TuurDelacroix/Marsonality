# Analysis & Development Project -  ***Marsonality*** ü™ê 2052 - server project

Clone the **client** repo with SSH:
```git@git.ti.howest.be:TI/2022-2023/s3/analysis-and-development-project/projects/group-14/client.git```

Clone the **server** repo with SSH:
```git@git.ti.howest.be:TI/2022-2023/s3/analysis-and-development-project/projects/group-14/server.git```

Clone the **documentation** repo with SSH:
```git@git.ti.howest.be:TI/2022-2023/s3/analysis-and-development-project/projects/group-14/documentation.git```

## Before you start:
- Choose Zulu jdk version 11 or opendjk 11 (Configure through this through intelij)
- Make sure to clone **all** the repositories **client**, **server** & **documentation**
    - **Use the following folder structure**
        - root_folder_with_name_of_choice
            - client
            - documentation
            - server

## Local testing and quality checks
You can **run** the Sonar validator and code coverage **locally!**

There is no need to push to the server to check if you are compliant with our rules.
In the interest of sparing the server, please result to local testing as often as possible.

**If everyone pushes to test, the remote will not last.**

Use the sonarlint plugin to see any code smells.
  - In the sonarlint plugin.
  - Open the report tab
  - Click on the Analyze all project files button. (left side)

## Configuring properties
All properties for a local setup are located in **conf/config.json**.

The remote properties are located on the remote server.

Add properties to conf/config.json are not automatically pushed to the remote server.

Adding new properties to the local config file is perfectly fine.

However, to apply new properties or property modifications on the server please contact mr. Blomme on MS Teams. With the following data:

  - valid config file in json format with filename config-group-XX.

Please, test the config file thoroughly on your local machine as mistakes will not be fixed every day.

## What's included
  - A openapi specification linked to the endpoints in the MarsH2Repository
  - H2 database web console
  - The setup of a vert.x and openapi (WebServer.java)
  - A starter class for the RTC topic (MarsRtcBridge.java)
  - Database generation scripts

## How to run the start project locally
In Intelij choose gradle task **run**.

## Location OpenApi Specification
The location of the openapi specification is defined in the file **config**.

The property is called **api.url**.

By default, the local setup will pick the openapi specification located at https://project-ii.ti.howest.be/monitor/apis/group-14.

If for some reason, the api isn't available or you want to use the specification in your **local** documentation folder.
```json
"api": {
"url": "../documentation/api-spec/openapi-mars.yaml"
}
```
 - For the to work, the folder structure must be organised as describe above.

## Local endpoints
 - H2 web client
   - localhost:9000
   - url: jdbc:h2:./db-14
   - no credentials
 - Web api
   - localhost:8080/api/{endpoint}
 - Web client
   - launch through webstorm/phpstorm (see client-side readme)
  
## Production endpoints
 - H2 web client
   - https://project-ii.ti.howest.be/db-14
   - url: jdbc:h2:./db-14
   - username:group-14
   - password:see Leho for details.

## **Tests**
All tests are located in the standard location for java testing.

Sample test for Repositories:
``` 
@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
class RepositoriesTest {

    @BeforeEach
    void setupTest() {
        Repositories.shutdown();
    }

    @Test
    void getH2RepoWithoutConfiguration() {
        assertThrows(RepositoryException.class, Repositories::getH2Repo);
    }
}
```

## Keep the database up to date
There is no need to manually add entries into the database.

Please use the scripts: **db-create** and **db-populate** in the resource folder.
The only step you need to do yourself, *when running locally*, is using the following endpoint:

`‚ÄãPUT /api‚Äã/martians‚Äã/traits`

This will add all the traits of all martians in the related table.

Everytime you run the api, the database will be rebuilt to the state described in db-create and db-populate scripts.

The **db-create** script is responsible for the database structure (tables, primary keys, ...)

The **db-populate** script is responsible for populating the database with useful data.

## Adding/updating an openapi endpoint.
   1. Update the openapi specification in the documentation repo.
      2. Commit and push the results.
   2. Update the function **buildRouter** in the class **MarsOpenApiBridge**
      1. Map the operationId (openapi id) to a new function in the class **MarsOpenApiBridge**
      1. Create this new function in the **MarsOpenApiBridge**
   2. (Optional) Use the Request class to get the data from the ctx parameter. 
   3. Add the wanted functionality to the controller layer and the layers below.
   4. Add a new response function in the **Response** class if needed.
   6. Write unit tests
